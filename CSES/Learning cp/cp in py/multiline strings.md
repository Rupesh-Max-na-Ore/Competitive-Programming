# what is the use of """ """ in python?

In Python, triple quotes (`""" """` or `''' '''`) are used for **multiline strings** and **docstrings**.

---

### 1. **Multiline Strings**

Triple quotes allow strings to span **multiple lines** without using `\n` explicitly.

#### Example:

```python
text = """This is a multiline
string that spans
several lines."""
print(text)
```

**Output:**

```
This is a multiline
string that spans
several lines.
```

---

### 2. **Docstrings (Documentation Strings)**

Triple-quoted strings are used to document **modules, classes, functions**, etc. These are placed right after the definition and can be accessed via the `.__doc__` attribute.

#### Example:

```python
def add(a, b):
    """Return the sum of a and b."""
    return a + b

print(add.__doc__)
```

**Output:**

```
Return the sum of a and b.
```

---

### 3. **No Special Meaning Outside Assignment or Function/Class Bodies**

If you place a triple-quoted string somewhere else (e.g., between two statements), itâ€™s treated as just a string expression (and is discarded if not assigned or returned).

#### Example:

```python
"""This is a string, but it's not used or assigned."""
print("Hello")
```

Only `"Hello"` is printed.

### Summary:

| Usage                            | Purpose                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `"""string"""` or `'''string'''` | Multiline string literals                  |
| After `def` / `class` / `module` | Used as a **docstring** for documentation  |
| Standalone                       | Parsed and ignored if not assigned or used |

Let me know if you'd like to see how Python's `help()` function uses docstrings, or how to write them in a structured way (e.g., Google/Numpy/PEP-257 format).
