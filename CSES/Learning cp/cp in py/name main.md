The Python line:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
```

is a **conditional check** that determines whether the Python script is being run **as the main program**, or if it is being **imported as a module** into another script.

---

### âœ… Formal Explanation:

In every Python script, the interpreter defines a special built-in variable called `__name__`.

* If the script is **being run directly**, then:

  ```python
  __name__ == "__main__"
  ```

* If the script is **being imported** from another module, then:

  ```python
  __name__ == "module_name"
  ```

So:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This code runs only when the script is run directly.
    # It won't run if the script is imported elsewhere.
```

---

### ðŸ“Œ Example:

#### File: `my_module.py`

```python
print("This runs always")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("This runs only if you run this file directly.")
```

#### When you run:

```bash
$ python my_module.py
```

**Output:**

```
This runs always
This runs only if you run this file directly.
```

#### But when you import:

```python
# another_script.py
import my_module
```

**Output:**

```
This runs always
```

### ðŸ§  Why itâ€™s Useful

* Prevents certain code from running when the file is imported.
* Useful for test/demo code (`main()`), ensuring libraries behave modularly.
