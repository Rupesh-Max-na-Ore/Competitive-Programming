Great! Let's now explore **deep copy** in Python ‚Äî which is essential when working with **nested lists** or **objects inside lists**.

## üß† What Is a Deep Copy?

* A **shallow copy** (like `copy()`, `[:]`, `list()`) copies the outer list.
* But if the list contains **inner lists (or objects)**, it **does not copy them** ‚Äî it just **copies the references**.
* A **deep copy** makes **copies of everything**, even nested lists or objects.

---

### üîç Example of Why You Need Deep Copy

```python
import copy

original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

shallow = original.copy()
deep = copy.deepcopy(original)

# Change inner list in shallow copy
shallow[0][0] = 999

print("Original:", original)   # [[999, 2], [3, 4]] ‚Üê changed!
print("Shallow:", shallow)     # [[999, 2], [3, 4]]
print("Deep:", deep)           # [[1, 2], [3, 4]] ‚Üê safe!
```

## ‚úÖ How to Do Deep Copy

### üõ† Using `copy.deepcopy()`

```python
import copy

original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
deep = copy.deepcopy(original)
```

* This **recursively** copies all nested structures.
* Now, `deep` is **completely independent** of `original`.

---

## üß† Visualization

Let's say:

```python
original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```

### Shallow Copy:

```python
shallow = original.copy()
```

Now:

* `shallow` and `original` are two different outer lists.
* But `shallow[0]` and `original[0]` **point to the same inner list**.

### Deep Copy:

```python
import copy
deep = copy.deepcopy(original)
```

Now:

* Everything is **fully duplicated**.
* Changes in any level of `deep` do **not affect** `original`.

## ‚ö† When Do You Need Deep Copy?

Use **deep copy** when:

* Your list contains **lists of lists**
* Or **objects** that themselves hold state (like classes, dicts, sets)
