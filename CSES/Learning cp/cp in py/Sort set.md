To **sort words (strings) in a Python `set`**, you first need to **convert the set into a list** (since sets are unordered and not sortable directly), and then sort it.

### ✅ Example:

```python
words = {"banana", "apple", "cherry"}

# Convert set to list and sort
sorted_words = sorted(words)

print(sorted_words)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

If you want the result to remain a **set** (though unordered), you can convert back:

```python
sorted_set = set(sorted(words))
```

> But keep in mind: sets do **not maintain order**, even if you sort them first.

---

### 🔁 For Custom Sort (e.g., by length):

```python
sorted_by_length = sorted(words, key=len)
print(sorted_by_length)
```

Let me know if you need case-insensitive sorting or sorting based on other rules!
