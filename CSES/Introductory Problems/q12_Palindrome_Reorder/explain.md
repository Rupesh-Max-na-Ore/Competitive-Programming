You're getting **TLE (Time Limit Exceeded)** mainly due to this line inside your loop:

```python
stri.insert(mid, ch)
```

The `list.insert()` operation in Python is **O(n)** in the worst case, and you're calling it inside loops that run up to a million times ‚Äî leading to **quadratic time complexity**, which is not efficient enough for the constraint $n \leq 10^6$.

### ‚úÖ Efficient Strategy: Use `string concatenation` with list building (which is O(n)):

Here‚Äôs a **clean and optimized solution** using string building instead of repeated insertion:

### ‚úÖ Final Working Code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def make_palindrome(s):
    count = Counter(s)
    odd_chars = [ch for ch in count if count[ch] % 2 != 0]

    if len(odd_chars) > 1:
        return "NO SOLUTION"

    half = []
    middle = ''
    
    for ch in sorted(count.keys()):  # sort for consistent output (optional)
        times = count[ch] // 2
        half.append(ch * times)
        if count[ch] % 2 == 1:
            middle = ch * count[ch]

    first_half = ''.join(half)
    return first_half + middle + first_half[::-1]

# Input
s = input()
print(make_palindrome(s))
```

### üîç Explanation:

* `Counter` counts each character efficiently.
* Only **one odd-frequency character** is allowed in a palindrome (in the center).
* Construct half the palindrome and mirror it.
* **No `insert()`**, so this runs in linear time $O(n)$, acceptable for $n \leq 10^6$.

Let me know if you want a version without `Counter` or with step-by-step visualization!
