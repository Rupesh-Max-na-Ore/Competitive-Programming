Yes! Let’s **dry run your code** with `n = 279508`, explain why it fails, and **compare it with the correct approach step-by-step**.

---

## 🧪 Problem

Find the digit at position **279508** in the infinite string:

```
1234567891011121314151617...
```

---

## 🧩 Your Code (Simplified)

```python
def solve(n):
    d = num_digits = floor(log10(n)) + 1
    r, pow, allnine = n, 1, 0

    for i in range(1, num_digits):
        r -= 9 * i * pow
        pow *= 10
        allnine = allnine * 10 + 9

    l = r // num_digits
    rem = r % num_digits
    no = allnine + l

    if rem == 0:
        pow *= 10
        return str(no)[-1]
    else:
        no += 1
        return str(no)[rem - 1]
```

---

## 🔍 Dry Run: `n = 279508`

### Step 1: Estimate `num_digits`

```python
num_digits = floor(log10(279508)) + 1 = 6
```

So you're assuming the digit lies in the 6-digit numbers block.

---

### Step 2: Subtract digits in previous blocks

Loop over `i = 1 to 5`:

| i | pow   | subtract           | r (after)                       |
| - | ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 1 | 1     | 9×1×1 = 9          | 279508 - 9 = 279499             |
| 2 | 10    | 9×2×10 = 180       | 279499 - 180 = 279319           |
| 3 | 100   | 9×3×100 = 2700     | 279319 - 2700 = 276619          |
| 4 | 1000  | 9×4×1000 = 36000   | 276619 - 36000 = 240619         |
| 5 | 10000 | 9×5×10000 = 450000 | 240619 - 450000 = **-209381** ❌ |

→ You now get a **negative r**, which breaks the logic. You're assuming the digit lies in the 6-digit block, but subtracting too much.

---

## 🛑 Why it breaks

Because `floor(log10(n)) + 1` gives **number of digits in `n`**, not the **correct digit-length block containing the kth digit**. For this problem, `k = 279508`, and the digit might still lie in the **5-digit block** (between 10000 to 99999).

Your code **assumes** the digit always lies in a block equal to `len(str(k))`, which is **wrong** when `k` falls **inside the total digit count** of a **smaller block**.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Correct Dry Run (Working Logic)

Use this logic:

```python
digit_length = 1
count = 9
start = 1
k = 279508

while k > digit_length * count:
    k -= digit_length * count
    digit_length += 1
    count *= 10
    start *= 10
```

### Run:

| digit\_length | count | digits in block | k after subtract                                                |
| ------------- | ----- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1             | 9     | 9               | 279508 - 9 = 279499                                             |
| 2             | 90    | 180             | 279499 - 180 = 279319                                           |
| 3             | 900   | 2700            | 279319 - 2700 = 276619                                          |
| 4             | 9000  | 36000           | 276619 - 36000 = 240619                                         |
| 5             | 90000 | 450000          | **k = 240619**, continue loop since `240619 < 5×90000 = 450000` |

✅ So `digit_length = 5`, `start = 10000`

### Now find the number:

```python
number_index = (k - 1) // digit_length = (240619 - 1) // 5 = 48123
digit_index = (k - 1) % digit_length = 4
number = start + number_index = 10000 + 48123 = 58123
```

So digit is the **5th digit of `58123`**, which is:

```python
str(58123)[4] = '3'
```

✅ Final Answer: **`3`**

---

## ✅ Fix Summary

Your code overestimates the digit group by using `log10(k)`, but this doesn’t map to the *total digit position*. Instead, we must subtract digit-length groups from `k` **until** the digit falls *within* one.

---

## 🧠 Correct Function (Final)

```python
def solve(k):
    digit_length = 1
    count = 9
    start = 1
    
    while k > digit_length * count:
        k -= digit_length * count
        digit_length += 1
        count *= 10
        start *= 10
    
    number_index = (k - 1) // digit_length
    digit_index = (k - 1) % digit_length
    number = start + number_index
    
    return str(number)[digit_index]
```

Great question! The reason we do `k - 1` in both of these lines:

```python
number_index = (k - 1) // digit_length
digit_index = (k - 1) % digit_length
```

is because the positions in the infinite digit string are **1-indexed** (as per the problem statement), but Python strings and arrays are **0-indexed**.

---

## 🔍 Explanation with Example

Let’s say:

* `digit_length = 3` (we are in the 3-digit block: 100 to 999)
* `start = 100`
* You are asked for **k = 5**

Now, the infinite digit string (starting from 100) is:

```
100101102103...
```

Let’s look at the **first few digits** (positions 1 to 9):

| Position | Number | Digit |
| -------- | ------ | ----- |
| 1        | 100    | '1'   |
| 2        | 100    | '0'   |
| 3        | 100    | '0'   |
| 4        | 101    | '1'   |
| 5        | 101    | '0'   |
| 6        | 101    | '1'   |
| 7        | 102    | '1'   |
| 8        | 102    | '0'   |
| 9        | 102    | '2'   |

### Let’s calculate for `k = 5`:

* We subtract `1` from `k` to shift into **0-based indexing**:

  * `k = 5 → k - 1 = 4`
* `number_index = 4 // 3 = 1` → it’s the **2nd number** (since we start from 0), i.e., `start + 1 = 101`
* `digit_index = 4 % 3 = 1` → the **2nd digit** of `101`, which is `'0'`

✔️ So `solve(5)` should return `'0'`.

---

## 🧠 Intuition Behind `k - 1`

Think of the entire digit stream like a big array:

```
index:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ...
digit:  1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 ...
```

So:

* Position `1` → index `0`
* Position `k` → index `k - 1`

Therefore:

* `number_index = (k - 1) // digit_length` → which number in the sequence
* `digit_index = (k - 1) % digit_length` → which digit in that number

---

Let me know if you want this visualized or turned into a drawing/memory aid!


But can't we similarly do with these: 

    number_index = (k) // digit_length
    digit_index = (k) % digit_length
    
    number = start + number_index
    # print(number_index,digit_index-1,number)
    return str(number)[digit_index-1]?


That's a sharp question — let's break it down and **compare your approach with the correct one**, side by side.

You're suggesting this:

```python
number_index = k // digit_length
digit_index = k % digit_length
number = start + number_index
return str(number)[digit_index - 1]
```

Let’s see **why `k-1` is necessary**, and what **goes wrong** without it.

---

## 🎯 Let's take a simple example

Let’s assume:

* `digit_length = 2` (i.e., working with two-digit numbers: 10, 11, 12, …)
* `start = 10` (start of two-digit numbers)

And we want to find the **1st digit** in this block of the infinite string:

```
10111213...
```

---

## ✅ Correct (with `k - 1`)

```python
k = 1
number_index = (k - 1) // digit_length = 0
digit_index = (k - 1) % digit_length = 0
number = 10 + 0 = 10
digit = str(10)[0] = '1'
```

✔️ Correct answer: `'1'`

---

## ❌ Your approach (without `k - 1`)

```python
k = 1
number_index = k // digit_length = 1 // 2 = 0
digit_index = k % digit_length = 1
number = 10 + 0 = 10
digit = str(10)[1 - 1] = str(10)[0] = '1'
```

✔️ Still works in this case, but let's try `k = 2`.

---

## 😬 With `k = 2`

### ✅ Correct approach:

```python
number_index = (2 - 1) // 2 = 0
digit_index = (2 - 1) % 2 = 1
number = 10
digit = str(10)[1] = '0'
```

✔️ Correct result: `'0'`

---

### ❌ Your version:

```python
number_index = 2 // 2 = 1
digit_index = 2 % 2 = 0
number = 10 + 1 = 11
digit = str(11)[0 - 1] = str(11)[-1] = '1'
```

❌ Wrong! We expected `'0'`, but you got `'1'` from the next number.

---

## ✅ Why `k - 1` is better

Because:

* It handles **1-based indexing** correctly.
* Prevents off-by-one errors on the digit boundary.
* Cleanly avoids `digit_index = 0`, which leads to subtracting 1 from an index — dangerous when it's already at 0.

---

## 🧠 Final Rule of Thumb

Always **subtract 1 from `k`** when you're converting 1-based position into 0-based indexing for arrays or string positions.

So:

```python
number_index = (k - 1) // digit_length
digit_index = (k - 1) % digit_length
number = start + number_index
digit = str(number)[digit_index]
```

This is safe, clean, and always correct. ✅
