the test failure and the huge output give away the **main issue**: you're **not applying modulo arithmetic**, which is mandatory for such problems on platforms like CSES.

## ✅ What's Missing?

The number of valid partitions can get **very large**. You're required to output the result modulo some number — **specifically**:

### ✅ Use Modulo $10^9 + 7$ or $998244353$ (Check problem statement)

For **CSES** *"Two Sets"*, the modulo is:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7
```

---

## ⚠ Also Important:

Since we’re **counting partitions** that are symmetric (i.e., $A, B$ and $B, A$ are same), we divide by 2. But dividing modulo needs special treatment:

### ✅ Modular Division

We must use **modular inverse** of 2:

$$
\frac{x}{2} \mod m \equiv x \cdot (2^{-1} \mod m)
$$

In Python, this is:

```python
inv2 = pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)  # Fermat's little theorem
```

---

## ✅ Final Correct Code

```python
n = int(input())
MOD = 10**9 + 7

total = n * (n + 1) // 2

if total % 2 != 0:
    print(0)
    exit()

target = total // 2

# dp[i][j] = number of ways to make sum j using numbers i..n
dp = [[0] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 2)]

dp[n + 1][target] = 1  # base case

for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    for j in range(target + 1):
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]  # skip i
        if j + i <= target:
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i + 1][j + i]) % MOD  # take i

inv2 = pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)
print(dp[1][0] * inv2 % MOD)
```
