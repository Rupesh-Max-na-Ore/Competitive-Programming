Consider a money system consisting of n coins. Each coin has a positive integer value. Your task is to calculate the number of distinct ordered ways you can produce a money sum x using the available coins.
For example, if the coins are \{2,3,5\} and the desired sum is 9, there are 3 ways:

2+2+5
3+3+3
2+2+2+3

Input
The first input line has two integers n and x: the number of coins and the desired sum of money.
The second line has n distinct integers c_1,c_2,\dots,c_n: the value of each coin.
Output
Print one integer: the number of ways modulo 10^9+7.
Constraints

1 \le n \le 100
1 \le x \le 10^6
1 \le c_i \le 10^6

Example
Input:
3 9
2 3 5

Output:
3


what is wrong here: def ways(i, s, coins, dp):
    if s == 0:
        return 1
    if i < 0 or s < 0:
        return 0
    if dp[s] != -1:
        return dp[s]
    # not pick ith coin and move to next coin or pick it and stay here 
    dp[s] = ways(i - 1, s, coins, dp) + ways(i, s - coins[i], coins, dp)
    return dp[s]

n, sum = map(int, input().split())
curr = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(ways(n - 1, sum, curr, [-1]*(sum+1)))

Your implementation of the `ways` function intends to solve the **Coin Combinations II** problem (unordered multisets) using **memoized recursion**, but there is a **critical conceptual bug**:

---

## ‚ùå The Problem

You're using a **1D memoization array** `dp[s]`, which means:

* You are **ignoring the `i` index** in the cache.
* But the function's state actually depends on **both `i` and `s`**:

  $$
  \texttt{ways(i, s)} = \text{# of ways to form sum } s \text{ using first } i \text{ coin types}
  $$

Hence, caching only based on `s` is incorrect, because for different values of `i`, the number of ways to form sum `s` can differ.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Use a 2D DP Array

You need to cache using both `i` and `s`, i.e., `dp[i][s]`.

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è Corrected Python Code

```python
def ways(i, s, coins, dp):
    if s == 0:
        return 1
    if i < 0 or s < 0:
        return 0
    if dp[i][s] != -1:
        return dp[i][s]

    # Exclude coin[i], move to i-1; or include it, stay at i
    dp[i][s] = ways(i - 1, s, coins, dp) + ways(i, s - coins[i], coins, dp)
    return dp[i][s]

n, sum_ = map(int, input().split())
curr = list(map(int, input().split()))
dp = [[-1] * (sum_ + 1) for _ in range(n)]
print(ways(n - 1, sum_, curr, dp))
```

---

### Optional: Add Modulo

If required by problem (like CSES):

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7
dp[i][s] = (ways(i - 1, s, coins, dp) + ways(i, s - coins[i], coins, dp)) % MOD
```

| Issue                 | Fix                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1D memoization        | Change to 2D: `dp[i][s]` |
| Ignoring `i` in cache | Include `i` in cache key |

Would you also like the **bottom-up tabulated version** built from this top-down logic?

Let‚Äôs **formally derive** the solution for **Coin Combinations II** ‚Äî where **order of coins doesn't matter** ‚Äî starting from:

1. **Recursive formulation (naive)**
2. **Memoization (top-down DP)**
3. **Tabulation (bottom-up DP)**

We will build from first principles. This is a **classical unbounded knapsack** problem.

---

## üî¢ Problem

Given coins $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$ and a target sum $x$, count the number of ways to sum to $x$, **using each coin any number of times**, **but order does not matter**.

---

## Step 1: üîÅ Recursive Formulation (Without Memoization)

### üìå Subproblem

Let:

$$
\text{ways}(i, s) = \text{Number of ways to make sum } s \text{ using first } i \text{ coin types}
$$

We define a recursive function:

* Include coin `i`: stay at `i`, and reduce sum by `coins[i]`
* Exclude coin `i`: move to `i-1`, same sum

### üí° Recurrence:

$$
\text{ways}(i, s) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } s = 0 \\
0 & \text{if } i < 0 \text{ or } s < 0 \\
\text{ways}(i-1, s) + \text{ways}(i, s - coins[i]) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

### üß™ Python-style Recursive Code

```python
def ways(i, s):
    if s == 0:
        return 1
    if i < 0 or s < 0:
        return 0
    return ways(i - 1, s) + ways(i, s - coins[i])
```

### ‚ùå Problem: Exponential Time $O(2^n \cdot x)$

---

## Step 2: üß† Add Memoization (Top-Down DP)

We cache previously computed subproblems using a dictionary or 2D array.

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(None)
def ways(i, s):
    if s == 0:
        return 1
    if i < 0 or s < 0:
        return 0
    return ways(i - 1, s) + ways(i, s - coins[i])
```

### üïí Time Complexity: $O(n \cdot x)$

* $n$: number of coin types
* $x$: target sum

---

## Step 3: üì• Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP)

We now reverse the recursion to build from base cases.

### üí° State

Let `dp[i][s]` = number of ways to make sum `s` using first `i` coins.

But we can **optimize space** by using **1D dp**, since at step `i` we only need results from `i` or `i - 1`.

---

### üöÄ Final Optimized 1D Tabulation (Unordered multisets)

```python
def countWays(n, x, coins):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (x + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # base: 1 way to make sum 0

    for coin in coins:
        for s in range(coin, x + 1):
            dp[s] = (dp[s] + dp[s - coin]) % MOD

    return dp[x]
```

---

### ‚úÖ Why This Works

* We iterate over **coins first** ‚Üí ensures each coin is considered only once per sum.
* This avoids double-counting permutations like `2+3+2`, `3+2+2`, etc.
* We build combinations in **increasing order**, naturally excluding order variations.

| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Coin Combinations I  | `for s` then `coin` | all orders of coins (permutations) | Count ordered combinations   |

Would you like a full annotated Java version showing each step (recursion ‚Üí memoization ‚Üí tabulation) side by side?

tell me why do we need to consider 2d dp for memoization approach but only 1d for tabulation?

This is an **excellent and deep question**, touching on a key conceptual difference between **memoization (top-down)** and **tabulation (bottom-up)**.

We‚Äôll analyze it carefully.

---

## ‚ùì Why do we need **2D DP** for **memoization**, but **only 1D** for **tabulation** in Coin Combinations II?

### Let‚Äôs formalize first.

We're solving:

> **Number of ways to make sum `x` using coins `c‚ÇÅ, ..., c‚Çô` (infinite supply), where order doesn‚Äôt matter.**

---

## üß† Top-Down (Memoization)

We define the recursive function as:

$$
\text{ways}(i, s) = \text{number of ways to make sum } s \text{ using coins } c_0 \text{ to } c_i
$$

* Decision: at `ways(i, s)`, we can:

  * Exclude `c_i`: call `ways(i-1, s)`
  * Include `c_i`: call `ways(i, s - c_i)`

Here, the **state** is fully characterized by **both**:

* `i`: how many coins (and which ones) you're allowed to use
* `s`: the remaining sum

Thus, we must **cache/memoize on both `(i, s)`**, leading to **2D DP**.

### üîÅ Why not 1D?

If you use just `dp[s]` and cache based only on `s`, then:

* The same `s` may be computed multiple times for different subsets of coins.
* So your cache can return **wrong values**, violating correctness.

‚úÖ Therefore: **Memoization = 2D DP**

---

## üîÉ Bottom-Up (Tabulation)

Now let‚Äôs consider **bottom-up tabulation** for the same problem.

We initialize:

```python
dp[0] = 1  # base: one way to make sum 0
```

And then we do:

```python
for coin in coins:
    for s in range(coin, x + 1):
        dp[s] += dp[s - coin]
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Why this works with **1D dp**:

This loop structure ensures:

* You consider each `coin` **only once**, and then **add** its contribution to `dp[s]` for all sums.
* At each `s`, the value `dp[s]` is correctly built from smaller `s` values that **used only earlier coins**.

üí° Key trick: You process coins in the **outer loop**, and `s` in the **inner loop** (in increasing order). This means:

* At the time you're computing `dp[s]` with `coin c_i`, all contributions from `c_0 ... c_{i-1}` are already baked in.

So **you don‚Äôt need to store `(i, s)` explicitly**, because coin inclusion is naturally handled by the loop ordering.

‚úÖ Therefore: **Tabulation = 1D DP**, if loop ordering is correct.

---

## üîÑ Summary Table

| Approach                   | State    | Storage Needed  | Explanation                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memoization (Top-Down)** | `(i, s)` | `dp[i][s]` (2D) | You manually control inclusion/exclusion paths, so both `i` and `s` must be tracked in memo. |
| **Tabulation (Bottom-Up)** | Just `s` | `dp[s]` (1D)    | Loop ordering ensures coin selection happens correctly without explicit tracking of `i`.     |

---

## üß™ Analogy

Think of it like **building a wall**:

* In **memoization**, you ask: *how can I build height `s` using bricks up to type `i`?* ‚Üí You need to remember **which bricks you're allowed to use** = `i`.

* In **tabulation**, you build from the ground up. For each brick type, you lay all layers it can contribute to ‚Äî naturally growing the structure, no need to track brick types explicitly.
